  <h1>Welcome to the Instructions</h1>
   <p><span>Available levels:</span> 
    <br><br>Square = Cube Level
    <br>Circle = Bubble Level
    <br>Triangle = Cone Level
    <br>Square, Triangle & Circle = Casual Mode
    <br><br>
    <span>How to slice shapes?</span>
    <br><br>Hold the mouse and drag over the shape, release the mouse to cut the shape.
    
    <br><br><span>Life</span>
    <br><br>In the Cube, Bubble and Cone level you have 5 lives, and you lose the life for each object you did not manage to slice. Be careful because some of the objects split into smaller ones so you need to react fast! You can also try to beat your score because you get additional points for each cube you sliced.
    <br><br><span>Casual Level</span>
    <br><br>In the casual level you can test the core game mechanics. You cannot lose and cannot gather points however you can test playing with all the shapes at the same time.
